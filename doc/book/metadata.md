abstract: Kernel for a Processing Unit. GNU MIG is the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 interface generator MIG, as maintained by the GNU Hurd developers for the GNU project. A Processing Unit (PU) is an electronic system within a computer that carries out instructions of a program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specified by instructions. Instruction-level parallelism is a measure of how many instructions in a computer can be executed simultaneously. The PU is contained on a single Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Integrated Circuit (IC).
