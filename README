This is the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 interface generator `MIG'.

You need this tool to compile the GNU Mach and GNU Hurd distributions, and to
compile the GNU libc for the Hurd.


Generic installation instructions may be found in the file `INSTALL'.

NOTE: To compile this distribution, you will need a compilation environment for
the target Mach platform (e.g. the GNU Hurd).  Actually, just a compiler for
the right machine that can find the Mach include files will do (i.e. the
`include/mach' tree installed by the GNU Mach distribution).  If you tell
`configure' to produce a cross-MIG by giving `--target' and `--host' options
that differ, it will attempt to find a compiler for the target; for example,
with the command `configure --host=SOMETHING --target=i586-gnu', it will
automatically try to use `i586-gnu-gcc' for the target compilations.  If you
don't specify `--target', then the native compiler will be used and it must be
able to find a Mach include tree.  You can explicitly set the target compiler
and its `CPPFLAGS' and `CFLAGS' to use by passing `TARGET_CC',
`TARGET_CPPFLAGS' or `TARGET'CFLAGS' to `configure', e.g.:

	`configure TARGET_CC=i586-gnu-gcc' or
	`configure TARGET_CPPFLAGS=-I"$HOME"/some/where/include'
