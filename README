This is the GNU distribution of the Mach 3.0 interface generator `MiG'.

You need this tool to compile the gnumach and hurd distributions,
and to compile GNU libc for the Hurd.

Generic installation instructions may be found in the file INSTALL.

NOTE: To compile MiG you will need a compilation environment for the target
Mach platform (e.g. the GNU Hurd).  Actually, just a compiler for the right
machine that can find the Mach include files will do (i.e. the `include/mach'
tree installed by the gnumach distribution).  If you tell configure to
produce a cross-mig by giving --target and --host options that differ, it
will attempt to find a compiler for the target; for example, with the command
`configure --host=SOMETHING --target=i486-gnu', it will automatically try to
use `i486-gnu-gcc' for the target compilations.  You can explicitly set the
target compiler to use by setting `TARGET_CC' in configure's environment
(e.g. `TARGET_CC=i486-gnu-gcc configure').  If you don't specify --target,
then the native compiler must be able to find a Mach include tree.

Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
<bug-hurd@gnu.org>.  Requests for assistance should be made on
<help-hurd@gnu.org>.
