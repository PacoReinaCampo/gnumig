Version 1.5

* Add support for protected payloads.  The new `intranpayload' option
  can be used to specify a translation function translating payloads
  to values of the translated type.  This function will be used
  instead of the `intran' function to to look up the receiving object
  of a message in a server.  This makes it easy to use the protected
  payloads introduced in GNU Mach 1.5.

* Emit `X_server_routine' functions that can be inlined reducing the
  message dispatch overhead.

* Improve support for variable-sized c strings.

* Fix a warning when compiling generated files.

Version 1.4

* Don't accept the `-R' (msg_send) command line option anymore and make the
  `-r' one (msg_rpc) a no-op.

* Fix warnings when compiling generated files with recent versions of GCC.

* Handle the preprocessor option `-isystem' correctly.

* Cope with command line arguments that contain whitespace.

* Make the installation tree relocatable.

* Be more careful to catch write errors when closing files.

* Spurious deallocation of out-of-line memory has been fixed in case of an
  error while processing the RPC.

Version 1.3.1

* Fix warnings when compiling generated files with GCC 3.x.

* Fix alignment issues for greater than 32 bit types on 32 bit
  machines.

* Alpha fixes.

Version 1.3

* Minor bug fixes.

* The new keyword `retcode' is accepted as a parameter modifier.
  This does not do anything, but is accepted for compatibility
  with the MIG input syntax used with OSF Mach.

* The debian/ subdirectory of packaging files is now included in the
  MIG source distribution.

Version 1.2

* New option -n to suppress default output file creation.
  With -n, no output files are created except those named
  by other command-line options.

* New option -list to generate a file listing RPC names and message ID numbers.
  The output is in six columns:
    subsystem-name subsystem-base rpc-name rpc-num msg-id reply-id
  For example this output line:
    io 21000 io_read 1 21001 21101
  says that the file used `subsystem io 21000' and defined an RPC called
  `io_read' with message ID 21000+1 = 21001; the reply message ID is
  computed 21001+100 = 21101.  In this example:
    io 21000 io_reauthenticate 14 21014 0
  the declaration is a `simpleroutine' that expects no reply, so 0 is
  printed in place of the computed reply message ID.  The output list
  these examples is generated on a GNU/Hurd system with this command:
    mig -n -list /dev/stdout /include/hurd/io.defs

* Output files of C source now start by defining _GNU_SOURCE,
  for compatibility with the GNU C library on GNU/Hurd.

Version 1.1

* First official net release.

1999-05-23
Version 1.0.2

* Understand normal GNU --version and --help args.
* Find CPP in a more flexible fashion.

1998-12-04
Version 1.0.1

* This release fixes a bug in the `mig' driver script that made it fail to
  invoke the C preprocessor properly.

1998-08-19
Version 1.0

* MIG has been split into a separate distribution to make it easier to set
  up a compilation environment for GNU Mach and Hurd systems.  The mig
  program itself in this distribution has not been substantively changed
  from the version in the GNUmach 1.1.3 distribution.
